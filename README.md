 ## Description
![Landing Page]()
 <p>
    In this age of information it is easy for a simple web search to bombard a user with so much information that a user simply feels very overwhelmed. Now imagine a tourist in a foreign country who tries to look up something like ‘Tourist attractions in Kenya’ or ‘Hotels in Kenya’ if he/she is looking for information. Odds are that she will be bombarded with so many advertisements or other irrelevant information that he/she may simply loose interest.This is clearly a problem that needs to be solved. Fortunately a simple yet effective solution exists; a dedicated web application that lists and advertises all the major and minor tourist attraction sites in all the 47 counties in Kenya as well as the most convenient places for accommodation be it a hotel or a lodge.
